# Overview

We need a simply way to [anonymize data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization)
for exporting to various departments for analytics and troubleshooting.  This tool
allows us to annotate a DB schema with special comments that can trigger
different data mutations

## Workflow with Fake Pipe

Here's how FakePipe could work in a project's lifecycle. These steps assume
you're using Postgres database:

1. Add comment to table column: `COMMENT ON COLUMN user.phone IS 'anon: phone_number';`.
2. Pipe DB dump to fake_pipe: `pg_dump my_db | fake_pipe > anon-db-dump.sql`.
3. Send `anon-db-dump.sql` to needy people.


# Comment Dialect

Schema columns comments are in [YAML format](http://www.yaml.org/start.html).
Using some of it's option quoting, it can look very much like JSON. The reason
it was chosen over JSON is for the optional quotes. That means the following
syntax will resolve to the same Ruby definition:

```
---
color: red
width: 100
```

```
{color: "red", width: 100}
```

For single options, the quotes can be omitted: `color: red`.

Any keys unknown by FakePipe will be ignored. So annotations from other system
shouldn't interfere. We do hope the abbreviated YAML syntax is simple to parse
by all systems.

## Currently Support Mutation Methods

To get a current list try running `rake methods` from terminal.

```sh
$ rake methods
anon: address_city          # Faker::Address.city
anon: address_country       # Faker::Address.country
anon: address_line_1        # Faker::Address.street_address
anon: address_line_2        # Faker::Address.secondary_address
anon: address_postcode      # Faker::Address.postcode
anon: address_state         # Faker::Address.state
anon: bank_name             # Faker::Bank.name
anon: bcrypt_password       # bcrypt password as 'password'
anon: bcrypt_salt           # bcrypt salt used to generate password
anon: clean_phone_number    # Faker::PhoneNumber 10-digits only
anon: commerce_price        # Faker::Commerce.price
anon: company_catch_phrase  # Faker::Company.catch_phrase
anon: company_name          # Faker::Company.name
anon: decimal_number        # Faker::Number.decimal
anon: digit                 # Faker::Number.digit
anon: domain_name           # Faker::Internet.domain_name
anon: domain_suffix         # Faker::Internet.domain_name
anon: email                 # Faker email
anon: empty_bracket         # an empty bracket '[]' - good for json::array objects
anon: empty_curly           # an empty curly brace '{}' - good for json object and array fields
anon: empty_string          # an empty String
anon: first_name            # Faker::Name.first_name
anon: full_name             # Faker::Name.full_name
anon: guid                  # UUID
anon: ip_v4_address         # Faker::Internet.ip_v4_address
anon: last_name             # Faker::Name.last_name
anon: latitude              # Faker::Address.latitude
anon: longitude             # Faker::Address.longitude
anon: lorem_paragraph       # Faker::Lorem.paragraph
anon: lorem_sentence        # Faker::Lorem.sentence
anon: lorem_word            # Faker::Lorem.word
anon: md5                   # MD5 hash of cell contents
anon: number                # Faker::Number.number
anon: phone_ext             # Faker::PhoneNumber.extension
anon: phone_number          # Faker::PhoneNumber with punctuation and extensions
anon: ugcid                 # Six random uppercase letters followed by four random numbers - ex. 'ABCDEF1234'
anon: url                   # Faker::Internet.url
anon: user_name             # Faker::Internet.user_name
anon: uuid                  # UUID
anon: zip_code              # Faker::Address.zip_code
```

# Decisions
- 2016-06-08
  - parsing SQL file is okay for now. Reconsider using a temp DB when
    foreign keys need to be scrambled
  - MD5sum foreign keys


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fake_pipe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fake_pipe

## Usage


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
